# SASS Grid System
By: Nataly Salazar

This repo has the implementation of a responsive grid system in HTML using CSS and SASS. It is the first homework from the Desktop Application Programming class.

The grid system is based on a 12-columns grid, and supports different number of colums. In order to see how the changes will be, the grid has seven
rows and each row has the number of columns in this order:

* 1
* 2
* 3
* 4
* 6
* 8
* 12

This system has three maximun width resolutions:
1. Screens that have a width smaller than 520px
2. Screens that have a minimum with of 520px and smaller than 1250px
3. Screens that have a width equal or bigger than 1250px
